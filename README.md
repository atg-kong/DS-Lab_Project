## Dataset

The project analyzes export data containing:
- 500 records across 44 Asian countries
- 419 unique commodity types
- Export values in INR and USD
- Time series data from 2015-2024
- Quantity and unit information

## Features

- Comprehensive exploratory data analysis
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
- Time series decomposition
- Interactive visualizations
- Machine learning implementation for export prediction

## Key Analysis Areas

1. Top export countries and commodities
2. Export value trends over time
3. Commodity efficiency analysis
4. Geographical distribution of exports
5. Statistical testing and correlation analysis

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the `EDA/code/` directory for exploratory analysis
2. Check `ML implementation/` for machine learning models
3. View generated visualizations in `EDA/data visualization/`
